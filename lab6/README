Lab 6

Purpose: Create programs that utilize arrays and structs to pass and store
data, as well as calculate values based on that data.

Conclusion:

a) What I learned:
I learned how to use arrays and structs to pass and store data, and how to
make a program that acts as a log for various data types.

b)Pair Programming
Working with a partner for the prelab did help me understand how to make 
a makefile.

b)Bug Report
For the zombie program there are no checks for things like correct times, 
which I didnt add as the lab did not specify if they were needed or not, also
depending on if I figured it out or not the sundays program may not work 
correctly (I did it and it works now)


d) Improvements that could be made
I could add checks in the zombie program in order to see if entered values are
correct or not
