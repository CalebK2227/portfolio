It is best to use an array whenever you have a lot of the same type values. 
For example, if you need to use the numbers 1-10000 in your program you should
use an array, and for that example you could use a loop to initialize the array.
Arrays are also better when trying to loop through values, as usually those
values will be of the same type.

It is best to use a struct when you have multiple values of different types.
For example, if you need to store data about a person such as their age height
and name a struct would be best because it would allow you to store int and
char types. Structs do have a more complicated accessing sytem, especially if
you have an array of structs.
