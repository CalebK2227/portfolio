Lab 5

Purpose: Create programs that utilize structs and arrays to pass data, as well
as understand enumeration

Conclusion:

a) What I learned:
I learned how to use and initialize arrays and structs, take user input for
those arrays and structs, and how to initialize variables using enumeration.

b)Pair Programming
Working with a partner for the prelab did help me understand structs better
as well as the equations to calculate values based off the arrays and structs.

b)Bug Report
I had some issues with pointers and arrow form in the array struct file but 
after going to tutoring we figured out that removing some of the pointers
fixed the program as I may have incorrectly used them.


d) Improvements that could be made
My zodiac sign finder could be improved on a little bit, as my switch 
statement is a little crowded but it works so thats good.
