2.
    The error in the code is on line 13 with the function, which in the program
    is OS_HP-UX_print where instead of a - between HP and UX there should be a 
    _ as the - makes the function OS_HP minus HP_print and c does not 
    recognize it.

3.
    The output will be 1 because i is equal to one to begin with, and is 
    printed out, then the statement is checked with false and then the 
    program is false, if true, the program would run infinetaly

4.
    The output will be f is not 1.0 because when f goes through the for loop,
    the f at the end will go away therefore f cannot be equal to 1.0f.

5.
    int a cannot be two values at the same time, either it must be an array
    or just one value.

6.
    It would technically print nothing as stdio.h is not inlcuded but if it is
    it will print that the size of the array is 8 because it will print how
    much memory the specific unsigned long takes up. 

7.
    The difference is the space in the second scanf, which if removed will
    cause the program to skip over it because it reads the enter from the
    previous printf as the input and not allow the user to input.

8.
    The output will be
    i : 10
    sizeof(i++) is: 4
    i : 10

9.
    The program doesnt print out 02-02-2012 because the printf is not zero
    padded and the feild width is not defined. To fix it you would put
    %02d-%02d-%d in the print statement.

10.
    To fix the program add a negative sign to the i in the if statement 
    as in -i < n,

11.
    The program will not run properly and give a floating point exception

12.
    The output will be 8
