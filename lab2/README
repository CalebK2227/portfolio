Lab 2

Purpose: Plays rock spock lizard with computer and player, calculates 
geometry based on user input, determines closest flight departure time
based on user input, and takes a user inputted number and prints out
its english word.

Conclusion:

a) What I learned:
I learned how to make switch statements and if else statements and use them
to determine things in certain cases. I also learned how to create while loops.

b)Bug Report
I had quite a few issues with my code but they were mostly sytax error and were
easily fixed by reading over where the warnings were.
Whenever my lab2 file is compiled it does come up with a warning however the 
warning does not affect how the code runs as far as I can tell.


d) Improvements that could be made
I could probably make my code more effecient but I'm not sure how to right now
I could also improve upon the user interface a little bit.
