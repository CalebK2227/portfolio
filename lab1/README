Lab 1

Purpose: To use functions to calculate geometric values based on user input.

Conclusion:

a) What I learned:
I learned how to call functions from main and scan user input and run 
that input through the functions in order to return and print a
result, this time in the form of geometric calculations.

b)Bug Report
After I had resolved a few syntax errors with my code, which were basically a
few forgotten semi-colons, the program compiled without issues. However, 
when I tried to execute the program, the terminal gave me an error stating
that I did not have permission to execute, which may have been caused 
by me not giving myself the right permissions in VSCode. But I had already sat
down and written the code in one sitting so I took a break and came back the
next day, where the code compiled and ran without issue, so I'm not 
entirely sure what happened but the issue was fixed somehow.

The only other issue I had was that the hypotenuse function was not called
correctly in the perimeter function because I accidentaly wrote two equal
signs instead of just one, but deleting one fixed it and the code ran and
returned the correct values.

d) Improvements that could be made
In the future I would like to improve the look of the program so that
the calculations for different shapes are seperated more and the program
as a whole is easier to read.
