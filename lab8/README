Lab 8

Purpose: Create programs that utilize linked lists and allocate and free data
properly.

Conclusion:

a) What I learned:
I learned how to create linked lists with data in them and perform basic 
operations on them like adding, deleting, and finding nodes. I also learned
how to properly allocate and free data.

b)Pair Programming
Working with a partner for the prelab did help me understand how to add and
delete nodes from a linked list.

b)Bug Report
No bugs as far as I know


d) Improvements that could be made
My collatz.c program could probably be a little more effecient and make
better use of the tail pointer mentioned in the lab.
